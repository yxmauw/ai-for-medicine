Treat each axis image sequence as a channel (e.g. R in RGB channel)
* So instead of RGB, coronal image sequence is R channel - as a way to feed into the algorithm

Image Registration
* important step in 3D image pre-processing
* to ensure all axis image sequences are aligned to each other e.g. coronal slices are aligned wih sagittal slices
* Because sometimes patient moves/tilt between taking images of different axes
